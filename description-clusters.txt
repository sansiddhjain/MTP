BF_ADV : - 

KMeans - 
0 : small rise and then drop/continuous drop
1 : sharp rise for a while then slight drop
2 : sharp rise, drop, and then rise
3 : smooth fall, almost exponential in nature
4 : jaggedly rising

BF_INT : - 

KMeans - 
0 : small rise and then drop/continuous drop
1 : smooth fall, but sometimes in a jagged manner, and sometimes with a rise towards the end
2 : rise, but sometimes in a jagged manner
3 : rise, but several times a fall towards the end
4 : sharp rise, then slight jagged fall/stagnant

BF_RUD : - 

KMeans - 
0 : sharp rise, then slow rise, almost like a plateau
1 : no data / ZERO
2 : small rise and then drop/continuous drop
3 : smooth fall, but sometimes in a jagged manner, and sometimes with a rise towards the end
4 : sharp rise for a while then slight drop
